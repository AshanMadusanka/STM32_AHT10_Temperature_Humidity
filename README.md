# STM32_AHT10_Temperature_Humidity
This repository contains code for interfacing the AHT10 temperature and humidity sensor with the STM32 microcontroller. The code is written in C and uses the HAL library. The code can read the temperature and humidity values from the sensor and display them on a serial monitor.
